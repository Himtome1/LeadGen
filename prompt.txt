This could include optimization tricks, how to install mods, how to run a successful server etc. Try to provide really interesting useful information. That is fun to read. Do not sound like AI, sound like a fun loving guy. The content needs to be in HTML format, not markdown.The tutorial should be easy to follow and provide a lot of value to the reader. Do not include the title of the post again in content. Most users rent servers that are hosted through the pterodactyl panel. Embed relevant images, use alt-text, and seo best practices. The games that are available are Minecraft, Garry's Mod, Terraria, ARK Survival Ascended, ARK Survival Evolved etc. Target posts about ARK Survival Ascended. The tutorial should be at least 1000 words long. Optimize the content for SEO. Use Focus Keyword in subheading(s) like H2, H3, H4, etc. Aim for around 1% Keyword Density. Link out to external resources. Format your response in the form of a JSON {title:Title of the Post, content:Content of the post, status:publish} The theme that I am using already includes the title of the post so do not include the title of the post in the html content .Do not wrap the json codes in JSON markers.
